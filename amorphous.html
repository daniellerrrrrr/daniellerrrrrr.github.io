    <p><b>Tasks</b> Conceptualization, 3D Modelling, Rigging, Animation, Post production, Storyboarding</p>

  <h3>Concept</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of the project, each of us came up with ideas and concepts for a story. I created a rough storyboard detailing the encounter of an astronaut with an alien. We settled on this story, and further revised it. </p>

  <h3>Modelling</h3>
  <p>To split up the work, our team decided to divide up the film according to its 4 major environments. I was responsible for modelling the astronaut, space station, datapad, planets, and the last environment seen in the film.</p>

  <h3>Animating</h3>
  <p>As each team member was already assigned one of the four environments, we split up animation in the same way. Everyone was responsible for animating the action taking place in their particular environment. In addition to animating my scenes, I also animated the planet intro at the beginning of the film, and a transition scene between two environments near the beginning.</p>

  <p>â€‹I also created looping walk and run cycles for the astronaut and cat for my team mates, to help cut down on time spent having to manually keyframe movement in their particular scenes.</p>

  <h3>Editing</h3>
  <p>I was responsible for adding visual effects to our film. To create backgrounds, I first created a gradient for the sky, and then added stars using After Effects simulations, and finally rays of light for variety.</p>

  <p>There were also a few instances where I had to overlay an image we created onto our 3D renders. For example, in one scene, the astronaut opens up a holographic map. I had to overlay the map on top of the rectangle, and made sure it fit the changing shape.</p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>This project was full of learning experiences, as it was the first time any of us had used Autodesk Maya. However, as we became more familiar with the program, we were able to split up tasks in a way that let each of us demonstrate our strengths. For example, one member was very good at modelling environments, while another member was able to animate very quickly.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we were able to create an film that although altered in some ways, was faithful to our original concept and vision.</p>
