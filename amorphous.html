            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>Amorphous is a 3D animated short about an astronaut on an alien planet and his encounter with a strange creature. This short was created over a period of 4 months for an introductory animation course.</p>

            <p>I worked on the narrative concept, modelling and rigging of the main character and a portion of the art assets, and editing together a section of the final film.</p>

          <h3>Preparation</h3>
          <p>The design brief for this project was to create a short 3D animated narrative, using Maya. As a team we got together to brainstorm some ideas, and I boarded out a story about an astronaut that meets an alien who turns out to be a very sinister character. We split the short among our 4 teammates by environment, so each member was responsible for a quarter of the final short.</p>

          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p>I was responsible for modelling and animating the astronaut character and the 3D art assets in my scenes. I also rigged and created walk cycles to save my other team members animating time. After rendering out our frames, I edited together my shots, worked on compiling the whole short together, and added visual effects such as the sky, 2D assets, and lighting.</p>

          <h3>Problems and Resolutions</h3>
          <p>The major challenge of working on this project was learning Maya and using it to create an animated short at the same time. As a team we made sure to communicate any tips, shortcuts, and workflows to each other as we learned the ins and outs of the program together.</p>

          <p>Working as a team of 4 also presented its unique challenges. We split the animation work based on the 4 different areas the main character travels through, but we also had to make sure that our scenes felt consistent across the whole short. To do this, we created concept art that everyone could refer back to and walk cycles for the characters that everyone would use in their scene. At the end of the project, one member did an editing pass to cut our different shots together and apply extra effects to tie everything together visually.</p>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>By being open to suggestions and knowing when to cut or adapt our original ideas, I'm satisfied that we were able to successfully tell a complete story while still being faithful to our initial concept and vision. </p>
