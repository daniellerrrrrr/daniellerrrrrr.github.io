      <h2>ABM Marketing</h2>

    <div class="project">

      <p>At ABM (Applied Biological Materials), I worked as a marketing assistant. My role consisted of creating various ads, miscellaneous graphics, diagrams, website layouts, flyers, brochures, web banners, e-books, and videos for internal company use as well as for customers.</p>

      <h3>Videos</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of the project, each of us came up with ideas and concepts for a story. I created a rough storyboard detailing the encounter of an astronaut with an alien. We settled on this story, and further revised it.</p>

      <h3>Design Work</h3>
      <p>These images were used in promotional emails sent out to customers.</p>

      <h3>Print Materials</h3>
      <p>During my time at ABM, I created a few report templates, e books, and manuals. These materials were used for internal use, as well as used by the scientists and distributed to customers</p>

      <h3>Website Layouts</h3>
      <p>I helped to create mockups for a cell biology home page, as well as their knowledge base pages. I was also tasked with implementing these changes, using HTML and css with the dreamweaver program.</p>
