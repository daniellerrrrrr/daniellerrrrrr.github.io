  <h2>ABM Marketing</h2>

<div class="container">
  <p class="blurb">At Applied Biological Materials, I worked as a marketing assistant. My role consisted of creating various ads, miscellaneous graphics, diagrams, website layouts, flyers, brochures, web banners, e-books, and videos for internal company use as well as for customers.</p>

  <div class="info">
    <p><b>Tasks</b> Graphic design, video editing</p>
    <p><b>Tools</b> Adobe creative suite, audacity</p>
    <p><b>Position</b> Marketing Assistant</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Videos</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of the project, each of us came up with ideas and concepts for a story. I created a rough storyboard detailing the encounter of an astronaut with an alien. We settled on this story, and further revised it.</p>

  <h3>Design Work</h3>
  <p>These images were used in promotional emails sent out to customers.</p>

  <h3>Print Materials</h3>
  <p>During my time at ABM, I created a few report templates, e books, and manuals. These materials were used for internal use, as well as used by the scientists and distributed to customers</p>

  <h3>Website Layouts</h3>
  <p>I helped to create mockups for a cell biology home page, as well as their knowledge base pages. I was also tasked with implementing these changes, using HTML and css with the dreamweaver program.</p>
