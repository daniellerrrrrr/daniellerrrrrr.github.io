            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p></p>

            <p>My main responsibility over my year-long internship as associate artist at BioWare was to board out in-game cutscenes for Anthem, their newest online multiplayer action video game. I also completed miscellaneous 2D art as requested.</p>

            <p>These storyboards are under NDA.</p>

          <h3>Storyboarding</h3>

          <p>After creating a first draft based on a script, I pitched the boards to a team of individuals from narrative, animation, art, and audio departments. The feedback I received would then be incorporated into following drafts. Each board I worked on went through multiple rounds of revision depending on the complexity of the scene. Completed storyboards were then passed on to other departments to carry out the next steps.</p>

          <p>For some scenes I put my boards together into animatics. These rough animatics were a way to gauge timing and pacing of the scene, and were also another format used for presentation.</p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>The learning experience was a very valuable part of my internship. I learned a lot about the different teams and the collaborative nature of triple A game development.</p>

          <p>I think that my greatest accomplishments over the course of my year at BioWare were completing multiple storyboards for the game. Itâ€™s really cool to see work I did incorporated into the game! It was really daunting at first, but I received a lot of support along the way from supervisors and other teams.</p>
