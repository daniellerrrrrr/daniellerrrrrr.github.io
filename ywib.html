  <p class="blurb">As a member of the Young Women in Business’s Media and Design team at SFU, I was contacted to create promotional banners to share information with new and prospective members.</p>

  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>These images were used on the organisation’s Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages. The executive who ordered the designs initially wanted to put lots of information on the banners, but in order to simplify the look, I asked to cut down on the text.

  <p>The banner below was created to promote an event for club members. Originally I went with a red colour scheme, but adjusted it after the executive who ordered the banner wanted a gold theme instead.</p>

  <h2>Recruitment Video</h2>
  <p>For this project, I worked with a team of three to create a video promoting SFU's Young Women in Business club for their 2015/2016 recruiting period. The executives who requested the video wanted to show off three things to potential club members that they thought were important about their organization.</p>

  <p>The concepts requested were quite abstract and difficult to show explicitly, so instead we went with a music video that was more visually interesting. The song was chosen by YWIB members, and we edited the clips and effects in time to the music. For this video, my work is 0:24 to the end.</p>

  <h2>IWD Promo video</h2>
  <p>For this project, we were asked to create a short video to advertise YWIB's 2016 International Women's Day Conference.</p>

  <p>Similar to the 2015/2016 recruitment video, the concepts that were requested were a little abstract. We decided to go with a somewhat similar approach as the previous video. Another stipulation was that we had to match the print documents, which had already been finalized by another designer.</p>

  <p>In addition to brainstorming with the rest of my team, my role in this project was to overlay the text on the film and time it to the music. I was also responsible for creating the ending credits.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>An important aspect of this position with Young Women in Business at SFU was communication. I often had to communicate back and forth with the club executives to revise designs, and complete requests within given deadlines to their satisfaction.</p>

  <p>As the YWIB 2015/2016 promo video was created towards the end of summer, when the club was in the process of recruiting members for the new school year, there were no scheduled events that we could film.  Some of our early ideas for the film included staging a an event and filming that, but we decided to film an executive meeting instead, for a more authentic feel.</p>

  <p>Another challenge for both films was how to best communicate what the executives wanted. For the YWIB 2015/2016 promo we decided to portray the executives interacting with each other and having fun, and overlaid that with imagery that we associated with the different concept definitions they requested. For the IWD promo, we used footage of the previous years event to give a glimpse of what people could expect. The executive team asked for a few revisions along the way, but ultimately they enjoyed the final videos.</p>
