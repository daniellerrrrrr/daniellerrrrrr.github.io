  <p class="blurb">Beep is a 3D action adventure game about a shape shifting alien who must escape a hostile planet. The player controls a sphere that can morph in order to solve puzzles and interact with the environment. </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of the project, each of us came up with ideas and concepts for a story. I created a rough storyboard detailing the encounter of an astronaut with an alien. We settled on this story, and further revised it.</p>

  <h3>Level Design</h3>
  <p>I was also responsible for designing several levels of the game. Together with my team, we planned out levels, built them in Unity, and then playtested them with different users. We refined and adjusted each level as we received feedback.</p>

  <h3>Modelling and Animation</h3>
  <p>Our game was built using the Unity 3D Engine. First, we created models and art assets in Maya and Illustrator, and then we arranged them into the different levels in Unity. I was also responsible for modelling and rigging the different enemies, such as the cubes. Once the models were completed and textured, I brought them into Unity to animate walk cycles, run cycles, and various character animations.</p>
