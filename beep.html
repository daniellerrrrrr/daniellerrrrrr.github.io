            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>Beep is a 3D adventure game where the player controls a round ball that can morph into a cube. The player must evade enemies, retrieve their stolen spaceship, and escape a hostile planet.</p>

            <p>As a member of the art team, my responsibilities included creating concept art, modelling and texturing 3D assets, and animation.</p>

            <p>This project is a revision of a game initially created in 2017 for a game design course.

          <h3>Preparation</h3>
          <p>The first task we had to complete was a review of our previous game. Due to to time constraints and our own teamâ€™s skill level back in 2017, we felt that our first attempt was rushed and flawed. There were a variety of bugs, inconsistencies with level design, empty looking environments, and an incomplete narrative.</p>

          <p>Having identified the problems with our original game, we worked on additional research and conceptualization. I created general concept art for new assets and visuals, and worked with the rest of the team on brainstorming a narrative that would have a satisfying conclusion for the player. Concept art was made with the idea that we wanted to emphasize the square shapes and rigidity of the game world by contrasting it against the round and warm-colour palette of the player character.</p>

          <div class="space"></div>

          <h3>Modelling and Animation</h3>
          <p>Using our concept art as a base, I modelled and animated character and enemy models. We made sure to stick to strict visual styles and colour palettes to define the player character and make them stand out in contrast to the game world: the main character used reds, pinks, and round shapes, while cube enemies and the game world were made up of blues, greens, purples, and cubes and rectangles.</p>

          <h3>Cutscenes</h3>

          <p>I was also responsible for the opening and ending cutscenes of the game from planning to execution. We wanted to create an interesting opening and give the player a satisfying conclusion at the end. I started with storyboards to figure out how to I wanted to frame the crash landing, and then went on to build the cutscenes in Unity using their timeline feature. Audio was done by Nancy Chen. </p>

          <h3>Level Visuals</h3>

          <p>Working with the rest of the art team I also modelled and textured many game assets and then placed them into levels. I defined lighting and colour settings to show the passing of time and the changes in the environment throughout the game.</p>

          <p>Level 1 begins with the player crashing into an alien planet's forest early in the morning. In level 3, the player suffers a setback in their journey as night begins to fall.</p>

          <h3>Problems and Resolutions</h3>
          <p>Our main problem with this project was figuring out how to elevate our old game. As a team, we decided on revising the overall themes, completely discarding any old, hacky work, and redoing them using proper workflows.</p>

          <p>Mid way through the project, we realized that again we were running into the problem of not having enough time and being too ambitious in how many levels and mechanics we wanted to implement. In order to be able to create a final, polished game, we decided to cut back on our scope, by creating 5 levels instead of 6, and implementing only a few new in-game activities. </p>

          <div class="space"></div>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Over the course of this semester, our team has learned many valuable lessons about self directing and compartmentalizing a team in order to tackle creating a game with a large scope. For example, we split our team into separate groups: art, and programming, with each member being responsible for tasks such as level design, modelling, or coding of enemy AI. We also made use of collaborative tools such as Slack and SourceTree to effectively manage files and all the moving parts of the project without running into problems. Overall we were able to complete and deliver a game that demonstrates everyoneâ€™s hard work and is also a satisfying experience for the player. </p>
